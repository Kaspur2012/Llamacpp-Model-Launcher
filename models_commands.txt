----- USER-FRIENDLY COMMAND GUIDE -----
-- A curated list of the most important parameters with easy-to-understand explanations and examples.


----- Essential Parameters -----

-m,    --model FNAME
       Specifies the path to the GGUF model file you want to load. This is the most important parameter.
       Example: -m "D:\models\llama-3-8b-instruct.gguf"

-ngl,  --n-gpu-layers N
       [Performance] Offloads a specified number of the model's layers to the GPU's VRAM. This is the primary way to
       accelerate inference speed.
       - To offload all layers, use a high number like 999. The program will automatically stop at the max supported.
       - To use CPU only, set to 0.
       - If you run out of VRAM and the model fails to load, reduce this number until it fits.
       Example: -ngl 999 (Offload as many layers as possible to the GPU)

-c,    --ctx-size N
       Sets the context size (in tokens). This is the maximum amount of text (your prompt + the model's response)
       that the model can "remember" at one time.
       - Larger values require more VRAM/RAM.
       - A common value is 4096 or 8192. Llama 3 models can often use 8192+.
       Example: -c 8192


----- Performance & Memory Tuning -----

-fa,   --flash-attn
       [Performance] Enables Flash Attention, a technique that speeds up processing and can reduce VRAM usage,
       especially with large contexts. It is highly recommended to enable this if your GPU supports it (most modern
       NVIDIA GPUs do).
       Example: -fa on

-t,    --threads N
       Specifies the number of CPU threads to use for processing.
       - A good starting point is the number of physical cores in your CPU.
       - Setting it too high can sometimes hurt performance.
       Example: -t 8

-b,    --batch-size N
       The logical maximum number of tokens to process in a single batch during prompt ingestion.
       - The default is usually fine (e.g., 2048).
       - You might need to lower it if you run into memory errors with very long prompts.
       Example: -b 2048

--mlock
       Locks the model in your system's RAM, preventing the operating system from swapping parts of it to a slower
       disk drive. This can prevent stuttering and slowdowns during generation.

--no-mmap
       Disables memory mapping. The model will be loaded directly into RAM instead of being mapped from the file on
       disk. This leads to a slower startup but can offer more stable performance on some systems, especially if not
       using --mlock.


----- Sampling Parameters (How the model generates text) -----

--temp N
       Temperature. Controls the creativity and randomness of the output.
       - Higher values (e.g., 1.0) make the output more random and "creative".
       - Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused, predictable, and deterministic.
       - A value of 0.0 means the model will always pick the single most likely next token (greedy decoding).
       Example: --temp 0.7 (A good balance for creative yet coherent responses)

--top-k N
       Top-K sampling. The model considers only the top K most probable tokens at each step of generation.
       - This prevents the model from picking very unlikely, nonsensical tokens.
       - A value of 40 or 50 is common. Set to 0 to disable.
       Example: --top-k 40

--top-p N
       Top-P (nucleus) sampling. The model considers the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds
       the threshold P. It's an alternative to Top-K.
       - This allows the number of choices to vary dynamically based on the context.
       - A value of 0.9 or 0.95 is common. Set to 1.0 to disable.
       Example: --top-p 0.95

--min-p N
       Min-P sampling. A newer technique that helps curb repetitive and dull text by removing tokens below a certain
       probability threshold, relative to the most likely token.
       - A value of 0.05 or 0.1 is common. Set to 0.0 to disable.
       Example: --min-p 0.05

--repeat-penalty N
       Penalizes the model for repeating the same tokens or phrases, helping to prevent it from getting stuck in loops.
       - A value of 1.1 is a standard starting point.
       - A value of 1.0 disables the penalty.
       Example: --repeat-penalty 1.1


----- Multi-GPU Parameters -----

-mg,   --main-gpu INDEX
       Specifies which GPU to use for crucial calculations and to hold parts of the model that aren't layers.
       GPU indexing starts at 0.
       Example: -mg 0 (Use the first detected GPU for primary work)

-ts,   --tensor-split N0,N1,N2,...
       Manually splits the model's layers across multiple GPUs by proportion. The numbers represent ratios of the
       offloaded layers to be placed on each GPU.
       - The list should have as many numbers as you have GPUs you want to use.
       - The tool sums the numbers and calculates the percentage for each GPU.
       Example: -ts 3,1 (On a 2-GPU system, put 75% of the offloaded layers on GPU 0 and 25% on GPU 1)

-sm,   --split-mode {none,layer,row}
       Determines the strategy for splitting the model across multiple GPUs.
       - none: (Default for 1 GPU) All layers are placed on the --main-gpu.
       - layer: (Default for >1 GPU) Splits full layers across GPUs. Good for balancing memory usage.
       - row: Splits tensors within layers by rows. Can be faster but may use more VRAM on the main GPU.
       Example: -sm layer


----- Server & API Parameters -----

--host HOST
       The IP address for the server to listen on.
       - 127.0.0.1 (default): Accessible only from your own computer.
       - 0.0.0.0: Accessible from other devices on your local network.
       Example: --host 0.0.0.0

--port PORT
       The network port for the server to listen on. Default is 8080.
       Example: --port 8080

--api-key KEY
       Protects the server with a simple password (API key). Any client connecting will need to provide this key.

--chat-template JINJA_TEMPLATE
       Specifies a chat template to use, such as 'chatml' or 'llama3'. This is crucial for formatting the prompt
       correctly for instruction-tuned models so they understand system prompts, user messages, and assistant turns.
       Example: --chat-template llama3

--no-webui
       Disables the built-in web interface. Useful if you only plan to use the API with other programs.

----- Some stuff about -ot command ------

## Mastering `llamacpp`'s `-ot` Command for Optimized Performance

For enthusiasts and practitioners leveraging the power of `llamacpp` for local large language model inference, optimizing performance, especially on systems with limited VRAM, is a paramount concern. Among the arsenal of command-line arguments available, the `-ot` (or `--override-tensor`) command stands out as a powerful tool for fine-grained control over model layer offloading. This comprehensive guide will demystify the `-ot` command, its parameters, and provide practical examples to help you unlock its full potential.

### The "-ot" Command: Precision Control Over Tensor Placement

The primary function of the `-ot` command is to override the default behavior of `llamacpp`'s layer offloading. Instead of loading entire layers onto the GPU, this command allows you to specify precisely which tensors within the model should be allocated to a different memory buffer, most commonly the CPU. This granular control is particularly beneficial when dealing with large models that would otherwise exceed your GPU's VRAM capacity. By selectively keeping larger, less computationally intensive tensors on the CPU, you can free up precious VRAM for the more critical parts of the model, often leading to significant performance improvements.

The syntax for the `-ot` command is as follows:

```
-ot <tensor_name_pattern>=<buffer_type>
```

Multiple overrides can be applied by separating them with commas or by using the `-ot` flag multiple times. The real power of this command lies in its use of C++ regular expressions (regex) for the `<tensor_name_pattern>`, enabling you to target specific tensors with surgical precision.

### Demystifying the Parameters: Tensor Naming and Regex

To effectively use the `-ot` command, it's crucial to understand the naming convention for tensors within `llamacpp` models and the basics of C++ regex.

#### Tensor Naming Convention

While a definitive, exhaustive list can be model-specific, a general and helpful naming scheme is employed in `llamacpp`:

*   **`blk.<layer_number>`**: This prefix refers to a specific block or layer within the model. The `<layer_number>` is a zero-based index. For example, `blk.0` is the first layer, `blk.1` is the second, and so on.
*   **`ffn`**: This stands for the Feed-Forward Network, a key component of each transformer block. FFN tensors are often quite large and can be good candidates for offloading to the CPU as they involve more basic matrix multiplications.
*   **`ffn_down`, `ffn_gate`, `ffn_up`**: These are sub-tensors within the Feed-Forward Network.
*   **`attn`**: This refers to the attention mechanism tensors, which are generally more computationally intensive and benefit from being on the GPU.
*   **`exps`**: This is particularly relevant for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and refers to the "expert" tensors. Offloading expert tensors to the CPU can be an effective strategy for running very large MoE models on consumer hardware.

#### C++ Regex for Tensor Targeting

The `<tensor_name_pattern>` uses C++'s `std::regex` syntax. Here are some common patterns and their meanings in the context of the `-ot` command:

| Regex Pattern | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `.` | Matches any single character. |
| `*` | Matches the preceding element zero or more times. |
| `+` | Matches the preceding element one or more times. |
| `[set]` | Matches any single character within the set. For example, `[0-9]` matches any digit. |
| `(group)` | Groups a part of the pattern. |
| `|` | Acts as an "OR" operator, matching the expression before or after it. |
| `\` | Escapes a special character. For instance, `\.` matches a literal dot. |

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

Now, let's break down the commands from the Reddit post and explore other useful examples:

*   **`-ot blk.([8-9]|[1-9][0-9]).ffn=CPU`**: This command offloads the Feed-Forward Network (`ffn`) tensors of specific layers to the CPU. Let's dissect the regex:
    *   `blk\.`: Matches the literal string "blk.".
    *   `([8-9]|[1-9][0-9])`: This is a clever way to select layers from 8 onwards. It matches either a single digit from 8 to 9, or a two-digit number from 10 to 99.
    *   `\.ffn`: Matches the literal string ".ffn".
    *   **In essence, this command keeps the FFN tensors for layers 8 and above on the CPU.**

*   **`-ot ffn=CPU`**: This is a broader command that offloads all tensors containing "ffn" in their name to the CPU. This is a simple way to move all Feed-Forward Network components off the GPU.

*   **`-ot exps=CPU`**: As mentioned earlier, this is highly effective for Mixture-of-Experts models. It offloads all "expert" tensors to the CPU, which can dramatically reduce VRAM usage.

*   **`-ot blk.2.ffn_down_exps.weight=CPU`**: This is a very specific command that targets the `ffn_down_exps.weight` tensor within the 3rd layer (`blk.2`) and moves it to the CPU.

**More Advanced Examples:**

*   **`-ot "blk\.(1[0-9]|2[0-9]|30)\.ffn_.*=CPU"`**: This command would offload all FFN-related tensors (since `.*` matches any character zero or more times) for layers 10 through 30 to the CPU.
*   **`-ot ".*\.ffn_(gate|up)=CPU"`**: This regex targets the `ffn_gate` and `ffn_up` tensors across all layers and offloads them to the CPU, while potentially leaving the `ffn_down` tensors on the GPU.

### How to Determine Which Tensors to Offload

The decision of which tensors to offload depends on your specific hardware and the model you are running. Here's a general strategy:

1.  **Identify VRAM Bottlenecks**: If a model doesn't fit in your VRAM, the `-ot` command is your friend.
2.  **Prioritize Attention Tensors for GPU**: Attention mechanism tensors are typically more computationally intensive and benefit most from GPU acceleration.
3.  **Experiment with FFN Offloading**: Feed-Forward Network tensors are often large and less demanding on the GPU's parallel processing capabilities, making them prime candidates for CPU offloading.
4.  **Consider MoE Expert Offloading**: For Mixture-of-Experts models, offloading the expert layers (`exps`) is a very effective strategy to reduce VRAM consumption.

By understanding and strategically utilizing the `-ot` command, you can push the boundaries of your hardware and run larger, more capable language models locally with `llamacpp`. Experiment with different regex patterns and tensor targets to find the optimal configuration for your setup and enjoy a smoother, more efficient inference experience.

## Llama.cpp Model Launcher: User Guide

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Llama.cpp Model Launcher! This application provides a clean, powerful, and user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for the `llama-server.exe` tool from the Llama.cpp project.

Its purpose is to replace the tedious and error-prone process of typing long commands into a terminal. With this launcher, you can manage, edit, delete, duplicate and run all your language models with the point-and-click simplicity of a modern desktop application.

### 2. First-Time Setup

Before you can launch a model, you need to tell the application where to find two key items. This is a one-time setup, and your choices will be saved for future sessions.

1.  **Set the Llama.cpp Directory**:
    *   Click the **Browse...** button next to the "Llama.cpp Directory" label.
    *   Navigate to and select the folder that contains your `llama-server.exe` file.
    *   The application will verify that `llama-server.exe` exists in the selected folder.

2.  **Set the Models File**:
    *   Click the **Browse...** button next to the "Models File" label.
    *   Select the `.txt` file that contains your model launch commands.
    *   **File Format**: This text file must be structured with a model name on one line, followed immediately by its full launch command on the next line. For example:
        ```
		Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-UD-IQ3_XXS
		llama-server.exe -m D:\lm_studio\unsloth\Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-GGUF\Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-UD-IQ3_XXS.gguf -md D:\lm_studio\lmstudio-community\Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF\Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf --jinja -c 13000 -ngld 99 -ngl 99 -fa on --temp 0.8 --top-k 40 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0.05 --repeat-penalty 1.1 --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0 --cache-type-k-draft q8_0 --cache-type-v-draft q8_0 --no-mmap -ts 63/18 -t 8 --device-draft CUDA0 --main-gpu 0 --no-warmup --override-tensor token_embd.weight=CUDA0

        gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4
		llama-server.exe -m D:\lm_studio\lmstudio-community\gpt-oss-20b-GGUF\gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4.gguf --jinja -c 131000 -ngl 999 -fa on --temp 1.0 --top-k 100 --top-p 1.0 --min-p 0.05 --repeat-penalty 1.1 --no-mmap --split-mode none --main-gpu 0 --chat-template-kwargs "{\"reasoning_effort\": \"medium\"}" --no-warmup --parallel 1 --ubatch-size 4096 --batch-size 8192
        ```

Once both paths are set, the **Model Selection** dropdown menu will automatically populate with the names from your text file.

### 3. The Main Interface

The application is divided into two main panels.

#### Left Panel: Main Control & Display
This is where you select and control the model server.

*   **Model Selection Dropdown**: Choose the model configuration you wish to load.
*   **Web UI Options**:
    *   `Enable Web UI`: Keep this checked to run the standard web server. Unchecking it adds the `--no-webui` flag to the command.
    *   `Auto-Open Web UI`: If checked, your web browser will automatically open to the server's page (`http://localhost:8080`) a single time after the model successfully loads. It will then be unchecked so no more pages will open UNLESS you re-check it or relaunch the app.
*   **Process Control Buttons**:
    *   **Load Model**: Builds the final command from the editor and starts the `llama-server.exe` process.
    *   **Unload Model**: Forcefully stops the server process.
    *   **Exit**: Stops any running server and closes the application.
*   **Status Indicator**: A colored dot gives you an at-a-glance view of the server's state:
    *   **Red (Unloaded)**: The server is not running.
    *   **Yellow (Loading...)**: The server has started and is loading the model into memory.
    *   **Green (Loaded)**: The model is successfully loaded and ready to accept requests.
    *   **Red (Error)**: The server process terminated unexpectedly (e.g., due to a bad parameter).
*   **Output / Commands View**:
    *   The main text area shows the **live output** from the server by default, which is useful for monitoring loading progress and API requests.
    *   Click the **Commands** button to switch the view. It will load and display the content of a text file named **`models_commands.txt`**, which should be located in the same directory as the text file you selected for your "Models File". This reference file contains a comprehensive list of commands from the Llama.cpp project and can be customized with your own notes. Click **Show Output** to return to the live log.

#### Right Panel: Configuration Editor
This is where you can view and modify all aspects of the selected model's configuration.

*   **Model Name**: An editable field for the display name that appears in the dropdown.
*   **Parameter Editor**: A dynamic list of all parameters for the selected command.
    *   Flags (like `--no-mmap`) are shown as **checkboxes**. Uncheck to disable them.
    *   Parameters with values (like `-c 4096`) are shown as **text fields**.
*   **Add New Parameter**: Allows you to add any valid Llama.cpp parameter to the current configuration on the fly.
*   **Action Buttons**:
    *   **Add Model**: Prepares the editor for a new model configuration using a default template.
    *   **Delete Model**: Deletes the currently selected model from your `.txt` file.
    *   **Reset**: Discards any changes made in the editor and reloads the parameters for the selected model that is CURRENTLY saved in models text file.
    *   **Save to File**: Permanently saves all changes (name and parameters) to your `.txt` file.

### 4. Core Workflow: Launching a Model

1.  **Select a Model**: Choose a model from the dropdown menu on the left.
2.  **Tune Parameters**: The model's parameters will appear in the editor on the right. You can:
    *   Change the context size by editing the value for the `-c` parameter.
    *   Enable or disable a flag by checking or unchecking its box.
    *   Remove a parameter by clicking the **"X"** button next to it.
    *   Add a new one, like `--temp 0.7`, using the "Add New Parameter" section.
3.  **Launch the Model**: Click the **Load Model** button.
4.  **Monitor Progress**: The Status Indicator will turn yellow, and the Output View will show the real-time log from Llama.cpp as it loads the model.
5.  **Use the Model**: Once the log indicates the server is "listening" and the Status Indicator turns green, the model is ready. If "Auto-Open Web UI" was checked, a browser tab will open automatically.
6.  **Shut Down**: When finished, click **Unload Model** to stop the server or **Exit** to close the application.

### 5. Managing Your Models (alway keep a backup of Model File..just in case)

The launcher's configuration management features allow you to modify your model library without manually editing text files.

#### To Edit an Existing Model:

1.  Select the model from the dropdown.
2.  In the right panel, change the **Model Name** and/or any of its **parameters**.
3.  Click **Save to File**. The old name and command will be updated in your `.txt` file.

#### To Add a New Model:

1.  Click the **Add Model** button.
2.  The editor will be populated with a default template and a unique name (e.g., "New Model 1").
3.  **Crucially, edit the `-m` parameter** to point to the correct `.gguf` file path for your new model.
4.  Change the **Model Name** to something descriptive.
5.  Adjust other parameters as needed.
6.  Click **Save to File**. The new configuration will be added to the end of your `.txt` file.

#### To Duplicate a Model:

1.  Select the model you wish to duplicate from the dropdown.
2.  Click the **Duplicate** button.
3.  A duplicate model is created, you can delete/add parameters.
4.  Don't forget to click save to file if you like the changes.

#### To Delete a Model:

1.  Select the model you wish to remove from the dropdown.
2.  Click the **Delete Model** button.
3.  A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **Yes** to proceed.
4.  The model's name and its command will be permanently removed from your `.txt` file.

### 6. Running the Application

There are two primary ways to run this application:

#### Method 1: Run from Python Source

This method is ideal for developers or users who have Python installed and are comfortable with a code editor.

1.  **Install Dependencies**: The application requires the PyQt6 library. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt6
    ```
2.  **Run the Script**: Save the application code as a Python file (e.g., `launcher.py`) and run it from your terminal or preferred code editor.

#### Method 2: Compile to a Standalone Executable (.exe)

This method packages the application into a single `.exe` file that can be run on any Windows machine without needing Python installed.

1.  **Install PyInstaller**: This module handles the compilation process. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```
2.  **Run the Command**: Open a terminal in the directory where you saved the Python script. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=C:\path\to\your\icon.ico your_script_name.py
    ```
    *   `--onefile`: Packages everything into a single executable file.
    *   `--windowed`: Prevents a console window from appearing when you run the app.
    *   `--icon`: (Optional) Sets a custom icon for the executable. You can omit this flag if you don't have an `.ico` file.

After the command completes, you will find your standalone `.exe` file inside a new `dist` folder.


Common Issue:
When you click load model and nothing happens:
This usually means it doesn’t know where the llamacpp directory is. This usually happens to me
when I update to a newer release of llamacpp. Browse to the new llamacpp directory.
I am on window 10 so normally I just download the newest binary release of llamacpp, exact it
and point the app to the extract folder.
